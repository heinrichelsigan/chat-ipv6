All methods of ChatRoom SOAP Webservice wrere ported, 
but I dind't test all the methods as well,
because I'm in conflict, if to use RedIs for .Net Core Framework.
  *Why*?
Because the client Windows App shows strange side effects with Redis NuGet Packages like Sockets_Unofficial and TcpIOPipelines.
